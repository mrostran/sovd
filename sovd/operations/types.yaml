    OperationDescription:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - proximity_proof_required
        - asynchronous_execution
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Unique identifier for an operation
        name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Operation name
        translation_id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Identifier for translating the operations name
        proximity_proof_required:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            If true, the execution of the operation requires a proof of proximity.
            An SOVD client can use this information to filter operations
            in advance if a proximity proof cannot be provided.
            If true, the offline Capability description includes the attribute
            x-sovd-proximity-proof-required in the PathItem object.
        asynchronous_execution:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            If true, the execution of the operation is asynchronous.
            If true, the offline Capability description includes the attribute
            x-sovd-asynchronous-execution with the value true in the PathItem object.

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ProximityChallenge:
      type: object
      required:
        - challenge
        - valid_until
      properties:
        challenge:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Challenge which has to be solved by the SOVD client to prove proximity.
        valid_until:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: >-
            The time until which the challenge is valid.
