      description: >-
        This method acquires a lock from the SOVD server for the given entity to reserve
        its resources for exclusive access of a single SOVD client, i.e., prevent other
        SOVD clients from operating on the resources in parallel. Any further requests
        against the SOVD API towards controlling an operation (actuators, routines, and
        input control), e.g., start the execution of an operation, is rejected by the SOVD
        server if the required lock is not acquired by the same SOVD client.
        Once the lock is not required anymore, the SOVD client can delete the created lock
        resource by a corresponding DELETE request.
        In addition, an SOVD client shall provide a relative expiration time after which
        the SOVD server should release the lock automatically. The SOVD server might reject
        the requested expiration time if it is too long. As a result, the SOVD server
        deletes the corresponding lock resource.
